Starting Something New

Hello to All!

FlyinKibblez here.   I was able to complete an app for excel in visual basic using many differet forum posts I was able to search for.  This had me interested in learing more to have a better understanding on how to create programs for things I may use day to day.  Perhaps write some code for bots in my brothers twitch, etc.
